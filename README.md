# Accelerated Mobile Pages

The [https://www.ampproject.org](AMP Project) aims to improve the experience of
reading web content on mobile clients.

For it to succeed, it needs to be adopted by clients. We built [https://something.gd](Something)
because we felt this very pain-point and are passionate about improving how people
read and discover content on mobile.

# AMP on the desktop

There's no reason to only consume AMP enabled content on mobile. For that reason
we've built Safari and Chrome extensions that will load AMP versions of articles
when present.

## Safari

## Chrome

[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%E2%9A%A1%EF%B8%8F/igokgmnkplcfgnegidccbgmlnecaffhh](Chome Extension) that will check for an AMP version of pages and automatically load them
when found.
